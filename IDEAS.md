Sure, we can create a production-ready API using FastAPI. FastAPI is a modern, fast, web-based framework for building APIs with Python that is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.

The API will have two main components: a `predict` route which will handle POST requests containing user queries, and a `ModelWrapper` class which will handle loading the model and making predictions.

Here's an example of what the FastAPI application might look like:

```python
# api.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Any, Dict
from kosmos_model import ModelWrapper  # this is your model wrapper

class Query(BaseModel):
    text: str


app = FastAPI()

model_path = "/path/to/kosmos2.pt"
model = ModelWrapper(model_path)  # wrapper that loads the model and makes inferences

@app.on_event("startup")
async def load_model():
    try:
        model.load()
    except Exception as e:
        # log the error here or raise HTTPException
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Model could not be loaded")


@app.post("/predict")
async def predict(query: Query):
    try:
        response = model.get_response(query.text)
        return {"response": response}
    except Exception as e:
        # log the error here or raise HTTPException
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

You will need to define a `ModelWrapper` class in `kosmos_model.py` which handles loading the model and making inferences. This class should also handle any pre-processing and post-processing required by your model.

```python
# kosmos_model.py
from your_model import YourModel  # import your model

class ModelWrapper:
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.model_path = model_path
        self.model = None

    def load(self):
        self.model = YourModel.load(self.model_path)

    def get_response(self, text):
        # apply any necessary pre-processing here
        response = self.model.predict(text)
        # apply any necessary post-processing here
        return response
```

This example doesn't handle things like logging, testing, and deployment, which are all important parts of creating a production-ready API. It also assumes your model has a `predict` method that takes in a string and returns a string.

For error handling, FastAPI has built-in support for request validation and allows you to raise HTTPException with specific status codes and details if something goes wrong. In this example, any error that occurs during model loading or inference will result in a 500 response with the error message as the detail.

To run the server, use a command like: `uvicorn api:app --reload`. This will start a server on localhost at port 8000 by default.

Remember to test your API thoroughly and secure it properly before deploying it to production. For instance, consider adding rate limiting to protect against abuse and adding authentication if necessary.


Based on your requirements, we'll need to do the following:

1. Create a database schema on Supabase to store API keys and user data. 
2. Adjust the FastAPI application to authenticate API keys against the database.
3. Set up secure storage and rotation of API keys.
4. Create the necessary endpoints for managing API keys.

For simplicity's sake, let's say we have a `users` table on Supabase with columns `id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, and `api_key`. We'll need to store passwords securely (i.e., hashed, not in plain text).

Here is the algorithmic pseudocode:

1. Create a Supabase client and connect it to your database.
2. Upon startup of the FastAPI application, initialize the Supabase client.
3. In the `get_api_key` function, check if the provided API key exists in the `users` table.
4. If the API key exists, allow the request to proceed. If it doesn't exist, return a 403 error.
5. Create an endpoint for registering new users. Hash the user's password before storing it in the database. Generate an API key for the user and store it in the database.
6. Create an endpoint for rotating a user's API key. Authenticate the user, then generate a new API key and update it in the database.
7. Create an endpoint for deleting a user's account. Authenticate the user, then delete their row from the `users` table.

Here is the corresponding Python code using the `supabase-py` package and `bcrypt` for hashing:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends, Request
from fastapi.security import APIKeyHeader
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Any, Dict
from slowapi import Limiter, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address

# Initialize logging

# Initialize rate limiter
limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)
app = FastAPI()
app.state.limiter = limiter
app.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler)

API_KEY_NAME = "x-api-key"
api_key_header = APIKeyHeader(name=API_KEY_NAME, auto_error=True)

class Query(BaseModel):
    text: str

MODEL_PATH = "/path/to/kosmos2.pt"
model = ModelWrapper(MODEL_PATH)  # wrapper that loads the model and makes inferences

# Supabase setup
SUPABASE_URL = os.getenv("SUPABASE_URL")
SUPABASE_KEY = os.getenv("SUPABASE_KEY")
supabase: SupabaseClient = create_client(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY)

@app.on_event("startup")
async def load_model():
    try:
        model.load()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(e)
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Model could not be loaded")

async def get_api_key(api_key_header: str = Depends(api_key_header)):
    user = supabase.table('users

').select('api_key').eq('api_key', api_key_header).single().get('data', None)
    if user is None:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403, detail="Invalid API Key"
        )
    return api_key_header

@app.post("/predict")
@limiter.limit("5/minute")  # adjust as necessary
async def predict(query: Query, api_key: str = Depends(get_api_key)):
    try:
        response = model.get_response(query.text)
        return {"response": response}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(e)
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))

# Registration endpoint
@app.post("/register")
async def register(username: str, password: str):
    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())
    api_key = str(uuid.uuid4())
    user = supabase.table('users').insert({'username': username, 'password': hashed_password, 'api_key': api_key}).execute()
    return {'api_key': api_key}

# API key rotation endpoint
@app.post("/rotate_api_key")
async def rotate_api_key(username: str, password: str):
    user = supabase.table('users').select('*').eq('username', username).single().get('data', None)
    if user and bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), user['password'].encode('utf-8')):
        new_api_key = str(uuid.uuid4())
        supabase.table('users').update({'api_key': new_api_key}).eq('username', username).execute()
        return {'api_key': new_api_key}
    else:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403, detail="Invalid username or password"
        )

# Account deletion endpoint
@app.post("/delete_account")
async def delete_account(username: str, password: str):
    user = supabase.table('users').select('*').eq('username', username).single().get('data', None)
    if user and bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), user['password'].encode('utf-8')):
        supabase.table('users').delete().eq('username', username).execute()
        return {'detail': 'Account deleted'}
    else:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403, detail="Invalid username or password"
        )
```

Please note that this code has not been tested and is meant as a starting point. You'll need to adapt it for your specific use case and thoroughly test it before deployment. Always make sure to protect sensitive user data and comply with all relevant laws and regulations. For example, you might want to add email verification during registration, and secure HTTPS connections should be used for all interactions with the API.




Sure, here is the revised Dockerfile that skips model download during image creation and git cloning. It also leaves placeholders for environment variables:

```Dockerfile
# Use PyTorch as base image
FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.10-py3

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the packages:
RUN bash vl_setup_xl.sh

# Install gradio
RUN pip install gradio

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . .

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Set environment variable placeholders. You'll pass the actual values at runtime.
ENV SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
ENV SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
ENV STRIPE_API=your_stripe_api

# Run the command to start uWSGI
CMD ["uwsgi", "app.ini"]
```

You will need to pass the actual values for `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, and `STRIPE_API` as environment variables when running your Docker container. You can do this using the `-e` flag:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 \
  -e SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url \
  -e SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key \
  -e STRIPE_API=your_stripe_api \
  -v /path/to/model:/app/model \
  my-api-image
```

In this command, `/path/to/model` should be the path on your host where the model file is stored, and `/app/model` is the path inside the Docker container where you want the model to be mounted. Adjust these paths as necessary to suit your setup. Make sure that your application looks for the model in the correct directory inside the Docker container (`/app/model` in this example).



To create a production-ready `docker-compose.yml` file, we'll need to take a few things into account:

- Volume Mapping: This ensures that the data remains persistent even when the container stops.
- Environment Variables: For keeping sensitive data like API keys safe.
- Port Mapping: This maps the port on which your app runs within the Docker container, to a port on your host machine.
- Restart Policy: So the container restarts automatically if it crashes, or if the server reboots.
- Network: A custom network for communication among services.

Here is an example of a `docker-compose.yml` file that includes these considerations:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  kosmosx-api:
    image: kosmosx-api
    restart: always
    environment:
      - SUPABASE_URL=<YOUR_SUPABASE_URL>
      - SUPABASE_KEY=<YOUR_SUPABASE_KEY>
      - STRIPE_API=<YOUR_STRIPE_API_KEY>
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /path/to/model
        target: /app/KosmosX-API/model
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    networks:
      - kosmosx-net

networks:
  kosmosx-net:
    name: kosmosx-net
```

Replace `<YOUR_SUPABASE_URL>`, `<YOUR_SUPABASE_KEY>`, and `<YOUR_STRIPE_API_KEY>` with your actual values. Replace `/path/to/model` with the path on your host where the model file is stored.

Remember, Docker Compose is a tool that is used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. In this case, we have one service `kosmosx-api`. If you plan to add more services like a database, caching service, etc., you would list them under `services` and they can communicate with each other through the custom network `kosmosx-net`.

To run the Docker Compose configuration, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the service in the background.

For mass AI inference, you'll likely need to scale your service to handle the increased load. Docker Compose includes a scale command that allows you to easily scale a service:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --scale kosmosx-api=5
```

This command would start 5 containers for the `kosmosx-api` service. However, please note that you would need to set up a load balancer to distribute requests among these containers. Docker does not provide a built-in load balancer, so you would need to set this up separately.

Remember to always monitor your containers' resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.) to ensure they're not being overwhelmed. If a container starts to use too much resource, you may need to upgrade your server or optimize your application.



To deploy this application as a production-ready infrastructure platform on AWS, here are the key requirements:

1. **Compute**: The application will be hosted in Docker containers. These containers can be managed using AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) or EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). If you choose Kubernetes, you'll also need an EC2 instance for the Kubernetes master node.

2. **Storage**: The model file is quite large (20GB) so you'll need an Amazon S3 bucket to store it. You can then mount this bucket to your containers so they can access the model file.

3. **Database**: As your application is using Supabase, you'll need to ensure that the database is set up and properly secured.

4. **Load Balancing**: AWS ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) can be used to distribute traffic among your containers.

5. **Auto Scaling**: AWS provides auto scaling capabilities for both ECS and EKS. This will allow you to automatically scale the number of containers based on the load on your application.

6. **Security**: You'll need to set up security groups and IAM roles. The security groups act as a virtual firewall to control the traffic for your instances, and the IAM roles allow your services to interact with other AWS services.

7. **Networking**: Set up a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) for your resources. This provides a private, isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a network that you define.

8. **Monitoring and Logging**: Use CloudWatch for monitoring the performance of your application and for logging.

9. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automating your deployment process. You can use AWS CodePipeline for this.

Here's an example of a Kubernetes deployment configuration with these considerations:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kosmosx-api-deployment
  labels:
    app: kosmosx-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kosmosx-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: kosmosx-api
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kosmosx-api
        image: kosmosx-api:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
        env:
        - name: SUPABASE_URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: kosmosx-api-secrets
              key: SUPABASE_URL
        - name: SUPABASE_KEY
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: kosmosx-api-secrets
              key: SUPABASE_KEY
        - name: STRIPE_API
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: kosmosx-api-secrets
              key: STRIPE_API
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /app/KosmosX-API/model
          name: model-volume
      volumes:
      - name: model-volume
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: model-volume-claim
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kosmosx-api-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: kosmosx-api
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8000
  type: LoadBalancer
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: model-volume-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 30Gi
```

This is a basic example and it may need to be

 adjusted to suit your specific needs. 

You should store your secrets (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, STRIPE_API) in a Kubernetes Secret or use AWS Secrets Manager. In this example, I've used a Secret called `kosmosx-api-secrets`. You should create this Secret with your actual values.

This example assumes you have a Persistent Volume set up in Kubernetes for storing the model file. The Persistent Volume Claim `model-volume-claim` should be defined to claim storage from this volume. The model file can be uploaded to this volume using a Job or a manual process.

The LoadBalancer service `kosmosx-api-service` will expose your application to the internet. The Load Balancer's IP address will be automatically assigned by your cloud provider (AWS in this case). 

Please remember to set up the rest of your infrastructure including VPC, IAM roles, security groups etc. as well. You should also set up an auto scaling policy to automatically adjust the number of pods based on the load on your application. You can use the Kubernetes `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` for this. Finally, set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment of your application. You can use tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD or AWS CodePipeline for this.

If you are new to Kubernetes, I recommend reading the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) to understand how to use these features.



Apologies for the confusion. The provided YAML file is a single file that contains three different Kubernetes resources:

1. A `Deployment` that describes the desired state for your application, including how many replicas of the application to run.
2. A `Service` that provides networking and IP support to your application's replicas.
3. A `PersistentVolumeClaim` that provides storage resources for your application.

When you save this YAML file, you should use a `.yaml` or `.yml` extension. The filename can be whatever you like, but it's usually good practice to use a descriptive name. Given that this file defines a deployment for the `kosmosx-api`, you might name the file `kosmosx-api-deployment.yaml`.

To apply the configuration defined in this YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster, you would typically use the `kubectl apply -f` command, like so:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kosmosx-api-deployment.yaml
```

This command tells Kubernetes to create or update the resources defined in the YAML file in your cluster. If the resources already exist, Kubernetes will update them to match the state defined in the file; if they don't exist, Kubernetes will create them.


I will integrate the Kubernetes `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` (HPA) into the configuration, which will automatically adjust the number of pods in the Deployment based on the CPU utilization of the existing pods. Please note that the HPA works on the CPU utilization metrics, which means your application should expose these metrics to Kubernetes.

For this example, let's assume that if the average CPU utilization across all pods goes above 50%, the HPA will create new pods. The HPA will maintain the average CPU utilization across all pods in the Deployment at around 50%.

Here are your updated Kubernetes configuration files:

**kosmosx-api-deployment.yaml**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kosmosx-api-deployment
  labels:
    app: kosmosx-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kosmosx-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: kosmosx-api
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kosmosx-api
        image: kosmosx-api:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
        volumeMounts:
        - name: model-volume
          mountPath: /app/model
      volumes:
      - name: model-volume
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: model-volume-claim
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kosmosx-api-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: kosmosx-api
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8000
```

**kosmosx-api-hpa.yaml**
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: kosmosx-api-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: kosmosx-api-deployment
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 50
```

Save these as separate files, and apply them with `kubectl apply -f`.

The `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` is in a separate file because it's a different type of resource. However, it could be in the same file as the Deployment and Service, separated by `---`, if you prefer to keep all the configuration in one place. 

In this setup, Kubernetes will ensure that there are at least 3 and at most 10 replicas of your application running. If the average CPU utilization of your application exceeds 50%, Kubernetes will create new replicas up to a maximum of 10. If the CPU utilization drops, Kubernetes will remove replicas down to a minimum of 3.

Remember to replace `image: kosmosx-api:latest` with the actual path of your Docker image in a Docker registry such as Docker Hub or AWS ECR.

Additionally, please remember that setting up the Kubernetes infrastructure and making it production-ready involves many more steps and configurations, including networking, access control, security, monitoring, logging, and more.



To reliably deploy multi-modal AI models using Terraform, you will need to consider several requirements. Here's a list of some key requirements:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform will be used to manage and provision the cloud resources. This ensures that the infrastructure can be version controlled and reviewed like any other code.

Auto-Scaling: The system should automatically scale up and down based on the load. This can be achieved using Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) or cloud provider's native auto-scaling feature.

Self-Healing: The system should automatically recover from failures. Kubernetes provides self-healing capabilities by restarting failed containers, rescheduling containers when nodes die, and killing containers that don’t respond to health checks.

Load Balancing: To distribute network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much demand.

Security: Implement proper security measures, such as using secrets for sensitive data, limiting access with role-based access control (RBAC), and using secure network policies.

Monitoring and Logging: Implement a robust logging and monitoring system to track the system's health and performance.

CI/CD Integration: Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for automatic deployment and updates of the AI models.

Persistent Storage: For storing the AI models and other persistent data, you will need a persistent volume that exists across restarts of pods.

n this updated Jenkinsfile:

A 'Test' stage has been added after the 'Build Docker image' stage. You should replace the echo "Running tests..." command with the actual commands to run your tests.

A post section has been added at the end of the pipeline. This section defines actions to take after the pipeline has finished. The failure block is executed if the pipeline fails, and the success block is executed if the pipeline succeeds. You should replace the echo "Build failed!" and echo "Build succeeded!" commands with the actual commands to send notifications.

Please note that handling rollbacks in a Jenkins pipeline can be complex and depends on your specific use case. You might handle rollbacks by keeping old versions of your Docker images and Kubernetes configurations, and adding a stage to the pipeline to revert to these old versions if a failure occurs. However, this would require careful planning and testing to ensure that rollbacks can be performed safely and correctly.





--------------------
Given your Dockerfile and Kubernetes configuration, here's how you might define a Jenkins pipeline for building the Docker image, pushing it to a Docker registry, and updating the Kubernetes Deployment to use the new image:

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build Docker image') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t kosmosx-api:latest .'
            }
        }

        stage('Push Docker image') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'dockerHubCredentials', usernameVariable: 'DOCKER_USER', passwordVariable: 'DOCKER_PASS')]) {
                    sh 'docker login -u $DOCKER_USER -p $DOCKER_PASS'
                    sh 'docker tag kosmosx-api:latest $DOCKER_USER/kosmosx-api:latest'
                    sh 'docker push $DOCKER_USER/kosmosx-api:latest'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([file(credentialsId: 'kubeconfig', variable: 'KUBECONFIG')]) {
                    sh 'kubectl set image deployment/kosmosx-api-deployment kosmosx-api=$DOCKER_USER/kosmosx-api:latest --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG'
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        failure {
            // Add your notification commands here
            sh 'echo "Build failed!"'
        }

        success {
            // Add your notification commands here
            sh 'echo "Build succeeded!"'
        }
    }
}
Copy code
In this Jenkinsfile:

The 'Build Docker image' stage builds the Docker image for the AI model using the Dockerfile in the current directory.

The 'Push Docker image' stage pushes the Docker image to a Docker registry. It uses a Jenkins credential called 'dockerHubCredentials' to authenticate with the Docker registry.

The 'Deploy to Kubernetes' stage updates the Kubernetes Deployment to use the new Docker image. It uses a Jenkins credential called 'kubeconfig' to authenticate with the Kubernetes cluster.

The post section defines actions to take after the pipeline has finished. The failure block is executed if the pipeline fails, and the success block is executed if the pipeline succeeds.

You would need to replace 'dockerHubCredentials' and 'kubeconfig' with your actual Jenkins credential IDs.

Please note that this is a basic example and does not include all the best practices for a production-ready CI/CD pipeline. For example, you might want to add stages for running tests, handling rollbacks, sending notifications, etc. Also, remember to handle sensitive data like API keys or passwords securely.




# Jenkins

Integrating Jenkins into this setup would involve setting up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Jenkins would be responsible for building the Docker image for the AI model, pushing it to a Docker registry, and updating the Kubernetes Deployment to use the new image.

Here's a high-level overview of the architecture:

Code Repository: This is where your AI model's code is stored. It could be a Git repository on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.

Jenkins Server: Jenkins watches the code repository for changes. When a change is detected (e.g., when a commit is pushed), Jenkins triggers a new build.

Docker: Jenkins builds a Docker image for the AI model using a Dockerfile in the code repository.

Docker Registry: The Docker image is pushed to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GCR, etc.).

Kubernetes Cluster: The Kubernetes Deployment is updated to use the new Docker image. The Deployment automatically rolls out the update across the cluster.

AWS EKS: The Kubernetes cluster is managed by AWS EKS.

Here's an example of how you might define a Jenkins pipeline for this process:

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build Docker image') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t my-ai-model:latest .'
            }
        }

        stage('Push Docker image') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'dockerHubCredentials', usernameVariable: 'DOCKER_USER', passwordVariable: 'DOCKER_PASS')]) {
                    sh 'docker login -u $DOCKER_USER -p $DOCKER_PASS'
                    sh 'docker tag my-ai-model:latest $DOCKER_USER/my-ai-model:latest'
                    sh 'docker push $DOCKER_USER/my-ai-model:latest'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([file(credentialsId: 'kubeconfig', variable: 'KUBECONFIG')]) {
                    sh 'kubectl set image deployment/ai-model-deployment ai-model=$DOCKER_USER/my-ai-model:latest --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

This Jenkinsfile defines a pipeline with three stages:

Build Docker image: This stage builds the Docker image for the AI model using the Dockerfile in the current directory.

Push Docker image: This stage pushes the Docker image to a Docker registry. It uses a Jenkins credential called 'dockerHubCredentials' to authenticate with the Docker registry.

Deploy to Kubernetes: This stage updates the Kubernetes Deployment to use the new Docker image. It uses a Jenkins credential called 'kubeconfig' to authenticate with the Kubernetes cluster.

You would need to replace 'dockerHubCredentials' and 'kubeconfig' with your actual Jenkins credential IDs, and 'my-ai-model' with your actual Docker image name.

Please note that this is a basic example and does not include all the best practices for a production-ready CI/CD pipeline. For example, you might want to add stages for running tests, handling rollbacks, sending notifications, etc. Also, remember to handle sensitive data like API keys or passwords securely.
